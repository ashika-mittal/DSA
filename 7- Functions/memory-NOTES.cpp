// A stack stores function calls in order — it’s called the call stack.

// Each active function gets its own stack frame, 
// which holds its variables, parameters, and return info.

// The current function (the one running right now) is always at the top of the stack 
// — when it finishes, its frame is popped off, and control returns to the previous function.
